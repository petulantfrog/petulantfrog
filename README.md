- 👋 Hi, I’m @petulantFrog
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning / ai, specifically moving towards working in natural language processing
- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  - basic python, python machine learning packages, python+flask, html, css, basic javascript
  - google cloud, how to manage a site?!, how to use github (lol meta)
- 📜 I'm a part time, third 'year' degree student with Open Uni, studying towards a BSc Hons Mathematics & Statistics, and a full time QA Automation Engineer
- 💞️ I’m not currently looking to collaborate, because I am just BAD AT STUFF. I'm muddling through the basics and maybe one day I'll be good
- 📫 I can be reached at jenni@petulantfrog.co.uk
